## 🚀 Your Next Steps

### 1. Quick Start (5 minutes)
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source lucy-env/bin/activate

# Set up API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Start chatting with LUCY!
python chat.py
```

### 2. Alternative Activation
```bash
# Use the activation script for easier startup
./activate_lucy.sh
# This drops you into a shell with LUCY ready to go
```

### 3. Document Collection (This Weekend)
```bash
# Run the document collection helper
python collect_docs.py

# Follow the checklist created in data/docs/collection_checklist.md
# Use INGESTION_GUIDE.md for comprehensive collection strategy
```

## 🔧 Virtual Environment Benefits

### Isolation
- ✅ No conflicts with your base Python environment
- ✅ Clean dependency management
- ✅ Easy to backup/restore
- ✅ Safe to experiment with

### Easy Management
```bash
# Activate LUCY environment
source lucy-env/bin/activate

# Check what's installed
pip list

# Update packages if needed
pip install --upgrade [package]

# Exit virtual environment
deactivate
```

## 📚 Document Collection Priority

### Phase 1 (Essential - Do First)
1. **1978 Triumph Spitfire Workshop Manual**
   - Source: Victoria British, Moss Motors
   - Save to: `data/docs/manuals/`

2. **SU HS4 Carburettor Manual**
   - Critical for carb tuning questions
   - Save to: `data/docs/manuals/`

3. **Lucas Electrical Manual**
   - Essential for electrical troubleshooting
   - Save to: `data/docs/manuals/`

### Phase 2 (Community Knowledge)
- **Forum Posts**: Use `data/docs/forum_post_template.md`
- **SpitfireGT6.com**: Best technical community
- **Common Problems**: Oil leaks, carb issues, electrical gremlins

## 🎯 Testing LUCY

### Basic Test (No API Keys Needed)
```bash
source lucy-env/bin/activate
python collect_docs.py
# Shows document inventory and creates helpful files
```

### Full Test (API Keys Required)
```bash
source lucy-env/bin/activate
python chat.py
# Start chatting with LUCY about her maintenance needs
```

### Example Questions to Try
- "Tell me about your carburettors"
- "I changed your oil yesterday with 20W-50"
- "How do I adjust your timing?"
- "What's wrong if you're running rough?"

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Virtual Environment Issues
```bash
# If activation fails, recreate environment:
rm -rf lucy-env
python -m venv lucy-env
source lucy-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Import Errors
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment:
which python
# Should show: /path/to/LUCY/lucy-env/bin/python
```

### API Key Issues
```bash
# Check your .env file exists and has the right format:
cat .env
# Should show:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_actual_key
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_key
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:
- ✅ Virtual environment activates without errors
- ✅ `python chat.py` starts LUCY successfully
- ✅ LUCY responds with her charming British personality
- ✅ LUCY remembers maintenance work you tell her about
- ✅ Document ingestion works when you add files to `data/docs/`
