## Parts/Tools Mentioned
- Standard metric and imperial socket sets
- Torque wrench (various ranges: 5-150 lb-ft)
- Thread locker compounds where specified
- Replacement fasteners (various UNF, UNC, NPT threads)
- Specialized tools: hub pullers, bearing installation tools

## Related Issues
Proper torque specifications are critical for:
- Preventing thread damage and stripped fasteners
- Ensuring proper clamping force for gaskets and seals
- Maintaining structural integrity of suspension and engine mounts
- Avoiding warped components (especially cylinder heads and brake rotors)
- Different torque values for different fastener coatings (cadmium plated vs. phosphated)

## Notes
Source: Robert Bentley Workshop Manual. Torque values may vary between early and late model years - always verify against your specific model year. Pay special attention to connecting rod bolts and main bearing caps as these are critical engine components. Some fasteners use specific tightening sequences (especially cylinder head studs). For color-coded or specially treated bolts, use the specified torque value for that coating type.
