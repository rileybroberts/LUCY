# Triumph Spitfire 1500 - Carburettor Tuning Guide

## SU HS4 Twin Carburettors - Detailed Setup

### Tools Required:
- Carburettor balancer (Colortune or Unisyn)
- 7/16" spanner for throttle adjustments  
- Small flat-blade screwdriver for mixture screws
- Tachometer
- Feeler gauges (0.002" - 0.006")

### Initial Checks:
1. **Throttle Linkage**: Check for smooth operation without binding
2. **Air Filters**: Ensure both K&N or paper filters are clean
3. **Vacuum Hoses**: Inspect for cracks or loose connections
4. **Float Chamber Levels**: Should be 5/8" below rim when measured

### Synchronization Procedure:

#### Step 1: Basic Adjustment
- Engine at normal operating temperature (180Â°F)
- Remove air cleaners for access
- Disconnect throttle return springs temporarily
- Loosen throttle rod adjustment nuts

#### Step 2: Idle Speed Setting  
- Adjust both throttle stop screws equally
- Target idle speed: 800-900 RPM
- Use tachometer for accuracy

#### Step 3: Carburettor Balance
- Connect carb balancer to both carb intakes
- Adjust throttle stop screws until both carbs show identical readings
- Readings should match within 5% at idle

#### Step 4: Mixture Adjustment
- Locate mixture screws (bottom of float chambers)
- Start with both screws at 1.5 turns out from fully closed
- Adjust for smoothest idle and highest RPM
- Final position usually 1.5-2.5 turns out

#### Step 5: Progressive Adjustment
- Snap throttle open quickly - should be crisp response
- Hold at 2000 RPM - both carbs should read identically
- Fine-tune mixture for smooth acceleration

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Black Smoke**: 
- Mixture too rich
- Turn mixture screws clockwise (leaner)
- Check float levels

**Popping Back Through Carbs**:
- Mixture too lean  
- Turn mixture screws counter-clockwise (richer)
- Check for air leaks

**Uneven Idle**:
- Poor synchronization
- Re-balance using carb tool
- Check throttle linkage adjustment

**Flat Spots on Acceleration**:
- Accelerator pump diaphragm worn
- Clean or replace pump mechanism
- Check fuel delivery

### Part Numbers:
- SU HS4 Rebuild Kit: AUD431
- Needle Valve Assembly: AZX1307  
- Float Chamber Gasket: AHH5749
- Throttle Spindle: AUD505

### Maintenance Schedule:
- Check synchronization: Every 6,000 miles
- Clean float chambers: Every 12,000 miles
- Rebuild carburettors: Every 50,000 miles or 5 years
