## Topic/Problem
Discussion about synthetic vs. conventional oil selection for Triumph Spitfire engines, addressing concerns about oil weight, ZDDP levels, and potential leakage issues with synthetic oils in older engines.

## Solution/Information

Yes, you can get synthetic oils in thinner weights (smaller marbles) but it is also available (at least here in the states) in comparable thicker weights (same size marbles). When I switched from Castrol 20W-50 to Mobil 1 15-50W, I actually found less of a tendency for oil pressure to drop during high speed runs or extended idling in the summer (e.g. the marbles shrink less when hot – which is a good thing). I had gotten the Mobil 1 since in that weight it has the necessary level of ZDDP so the more stable oil pressure was just a bonus. I'm not sure if the ZDDP issue is a problem over there like it is here.

As far as leaking goes, mine leaks both with dino and with synthetic. The best explanation I've seen is that synthetic is better at finding small openings so that a well sealed up motor won't leak but a marginal one may start to – can be a problem with our 30-50 year old gaskets. I don't know for sure if that's true, but it makes sense to me.

To me, a little extra leakage was a worthwhile tradeoff. I park over a piece of cardboard anyway.

Both of the above observations are based on a sample size of one and should be weighted accordingly.

If you're like many folks and putting 1000 miles or so a year on the car, this is all pretty academic anyway. These engines were good for 100,000 miles plus with 1960's oils, any modern quality oil will be fine. As Andrew says go with a 20W-50 or something of similar weight and watch those ZDDP levels.

## Parts/Tools Mentioned
- Castrol 20W-50 conventional oil
- Mobil 1 15W-50 synthetic oil
- ZDDP (Zinc Dialkyl Dithiophosphate) additives
- 20W-50 weight oils recommended
- Cardboard for leak protection

## Related Issues
Synthetic oils may find small leaks that conventional oils don't. ZDDP levels are critical for flat tappet engines. Oil pressure considerations with different oil weights. Gasket compatibility with 30-50 year old seals.

## Notes
Personal experience from one user - individual results may vary. For low-mileage classic cars (1000 miles/year), oil choice is less critical. Any modern quality oil should be adequate for these vintage engines that originally ran on 1960s oil technology.
