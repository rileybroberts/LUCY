## Topic/Problem
Safe procedure for removing the steering wheel from Triumph Spitfire and GT6 models without damaging the wheel, column, or windshield. The wheel uses a splined and tapered joint that requires proper technique to separate.

## Solution/Information

The wheel is fitted to the shaft with a splined and tapered joint and a nut (about 1 1/16″ or 3/4″ Whitworth), which together means that even if the nut comes loose the wheel should not be loose on the column, the taper must be 'broken' as well. The best way of doing this to avoid damage to both wheel rim and column is as follows:

1. Remove the horn push or centre cover (varies with model)
2. Slacken the nut by just a turn or two – make absolutely sure that plenty of turns remain engaged and the nut does not protrude too far above the end of the column. Be careful loosing the nut. Pull the wrench down from the left not up from the right… I cracked my windshield doing it that way…duhhhh.
3. Sitting in the drivers seat, draw your knees up behind the wheel and use them to apply pressure to the back of the wheel rim.
4. Wearing appropriate eye protection, place a medium hammer on the end of the column shaft. If you have a hammer with a ball-end then use this end against the column. Whatever hammer you use make sure the hammer is in contact with the end of the column and not the nut or you will damage the threads.
5. Strike the first hammer firmly with a second hammer.
6. After a couple of blows the wheel should pop free, but be safely retained by the nut which prevents it from flying towards your face.

## Parts/Tools Mentioned
- 1 1/16″ or 3/4″ Whitworth socket/wrench
- Medium hammer (preferably with ball end)
- Second hammer for striking
- Eye protection (safety glasses)
- Horn push or center cover removal tools

## Related Issues
Improper technique can damage threads, crack windshield, or cause injury. The tapered joint must be broken with impact, not just loosening the nut. Wheel can fly toward face if nut is completely removed before breaking taper.

## Notes
Safety is critical - always wear eye protection and ensure nut remains engaged to catch the wheel. The knee-bracing technique helps control the wheel when it releases. Practice proper wrench technique to avoid windshield damage.
