## Topic/Problem
Complete guide to the fuse system in Triumph Spitfire and GT6 models including fuse locations, ratings, circuits protected, and British to American fuse equivalents. Essential for electrical troubleshooting and fuse replacement.

## Solution/Information

The fuse assembly is a component of the main harness. It is secured to an aperture provided on the bulkhead by integral plastic clips. The unit contains three operational fuses and has provision to house two spares. The fuses are protected by a pull-off transparent plastic cover on the bulkhead adjacent to the clutch master cylinder.

Failure of a particular fuse is indicated when all the circuits protected by it become inoperative. If a new fuse fails establish the cause and rectify the fault before fitting a second replacement.

## Parts/Tools Mentioned
- Lucas 35 amp fuses (Part No. 188218, Stanpart No. 58465)
- BUSS AGC equivalent fuses (American)
- Transparent plastic fuse cover
- Integral plastic clips for mounting
- Various fuse ratings from 3-30 amp

## Related Issues
Fuse failure affects all circuits protected by that fuse. Always identify and fix the root cause before replacing a blown fuse. Different fuse ratings between British Lucas and American BUSS systems require conversion.
