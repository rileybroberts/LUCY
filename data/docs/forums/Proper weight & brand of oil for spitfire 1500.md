## Topic/Problem
Discussion thread about appropriate oil weight and brand selection for Triumph Spitfire 1500 engines, specifically addressing synthetic vs. conventional oils, ZDDP requirements, and compatibility with catalytic converters.

## Solution/Information

**Original Question:**
Anyone know if using a synthetic oil in a spitfire 1500 is advisable. The previous owner was using Mobile One 15-50. I have always used Castrol GTX 20W-50 in other British cars i have owned.

**Response 1:**
I use the same, I get it at my local Advance Auto Parts - with a Purolator Gold Filter

**Question:**
Whats the difference between the castrol and the valvoline?

**Andy's Response:**
Castrol is just basic oil, Valvoline is a high grade racing formulation and very highly rated in the classic car community.

**Follow-up:**
Thanks Andy, I will give it a shot.

**Robin's Question:**
Some oils made for classic cars come with the warning, "don't use in cars equipped with a catalytic converter". My 78 1500 has one of those, and I just replaced the Castrol with 40 weight Brad Penn Racing Oil. Did I make a mistake?

**Zinc Content Response:**
Valvoline has the high zinc - not sure of Castrol. I put synthetic on (Valvoline) but will switch to the conventional version next time, or maybe mix and do a synthetic blend. (Didn't notice any leaking with synthetics as some have suggested may happen)

**ZDDP Additive Info:**
Castrol does not have zinc so you have to use an additive like Lucas ZDDP or Delco break-in oil additive.

**Professional Oil Advice:**
Our club had an oil rep do a seminar and he said additives are not as effective as when they are already in the oil formula. I am now using Lucas Hot Rod and Classic 20/50 mineral which has 2000 ppm zinc.

**Vic's Industry Perspective:**
You guys make me laugh! Have you ever worked the line at a refinery? Every company's jugs go by and get filled with the same oil, the only difference is the final wrap. Google Strathcona Refinery.

**Iain's Technical Advice:**
Mobile One 15W-50 was a good choice. A 10W-40 is probably better for your engine if it doesn't get too hot (over 212Â°F for too long). Forget mineral oil, it's old tech. Use a good quality ester synthetic oil; will protect better. Use a "motor sport" oil if ZDDP or lack of it worries you. 20W-xx will wear your engine out faster than a 5W-xx or 10W-xx.

Synthetic oil being too thin is a fallacy.

**Oil Pressure Experience:**
I actually did find I lost some oil pressure with partial synthetic so I won't be using full synthetic at any time. This doesn't mean the protective film isn't doing its job but I have a little low oil pressure and don't want it any lower.

**Andy's Technical Analysis:**
If you're willing to rebuild a Triumph engine to modern tolerances, I'm sure the oil will be fine. But with the by modern standards gaping tolerances on our old clunkers, it's just too thin. Modern engines gauge tolerances in tenths of a thou, not thous or tens of thous. For example, the standard factory tolerance on a Triumph crank would be a regrind and new shells on my modern.

The lubrication system is also pretty marginal on most Triumphs, a lack of capacity in particular is an issue on modern roads.

That, and it's hard enough keeping thick 20/50 inside a Triumph, let alone anything thinner!

## Parts/Tools Mentioned
- Mobil 1 15W-50 synthetic oil
- Castrol GTX 20W-50 conventional oil
- Valvoline racing formulation oils
- Brad Penn Racing Oil 40 weight
- Lucas Hot Rod and Classic 20/50 (2000 ppm zinc)

- Lucas ZDDP additive
- Delco break-in oil additive
- Motor sport oils with ZDDP

## Related Issues
Catalytic converter compatibility with high-zinc oils is a concern for 1978+ models. Oil pressure drop with synthetic oils reported by some users. Engine tolerance differences between vintage and modern engines affect oil selection. ZDDP additives vs. factory-formulated high-zinc oils.

## Notes
Multiple opinions on synthetic vs. conventional oils for Triumph engines. General consensus favors 20W-50 weight oils. High-zinc content (ZDDP) important for flat tappet engines. Some users report oil pressure issues with synthetics. Professional advice suggests built-in additives are more effective than aftermarket additions.
