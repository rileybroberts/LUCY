## Topic/Problem
Analysis of gas strut installation for Triumph Spitfire bonnet (hood) support as an alternative to the original stay rod system. Testing different mounting configurations and pressure settings for optimal operation.

## Solution/Information

### Test Setup #1

Well for the first round of testing I'm using a set of [Stabilus](http://www.stabilus.de/index2.htm) units. **SACHS Stabilus LIFT-O-MAT** package label part numbers reads **SGSG230003**_\*_ above the barcode and **92134**_\*_ **SACHS NORTH AMERICA** below it. This 'kit' (one strut per kit) has an eyelet on the end of the ramrod and a ball/socket on the tube body end. The kit also contained a small metal bracket with a clevis pin as the mount on for the ramrod end.  You'll see why this mount type comes in so handy here.  They are 25" 'eye-to-eye" initial compression is 40 lbs.  At full compression (8-10" stroke) the pressure rises to around 65 lbs.  

     The drivers side radiator support rod, where it meets the original stay rod mount, was drilled out to accept a larger diameter 0.25" bolt.

        This original bolt was replaced with the M10- 1/4" ball needed to mount the rod end.

On the passenger side, I had to make a small bracket to mount the end of the stay rod. A simple 3/16" steel strap bent at 120� with two holes drilled to fit.

The strut mount at the bonnet tube looks like a screen door strut mount. This was simply 'hose-clamped' in position as I experimented with where on the upright I wanted to mount it. This let me adjust the pressure the strut put on the bonnet rod. At the radiator support bracket mount on the shock tower, I simply slipped my 'bent' bracket under the end and used a slightly longer bolt through it in the original holes. The radiator bracket helps to keep it from rotating. With the original stay rod in place these units where fitted to hold it in the same position. When closed, the pressure is almost directly inline with the pivot, nearly eliminating 'bending' forces of other configurations. This system easily held the bonnet open, but added very little in the way of initial opening weight reduction.

## Parts/Tools Mentioned
- Stabilus LIFT-O-MAT gas struts (SGSG230003, 92134)
- M10-1/4" ball mount bolts
- 3/16" steel strap for custom bracket
- Hose clamps for temporary mounting
- 0.25" drill bit for mounting holes
- Various bolts and hardware

## Related Issues
Gas strut installation requires careful consideration of mounting points and pressure settings. The original stay rod system may need to remain in place during testing. Different mounting configurations affect opening effort and holding power.

## Notes
This appears to be a detailed testing log for gas strut conversion. Multiple mounting configurations should be tested to find optimal performance. Eye protection and proper tools are essential for safe installation.
