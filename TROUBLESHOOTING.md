# üîß LUCY Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Common Warnings & How They're Fixed

### **ChromaDB Telemetry Errors (FIXED)**
```
Failed to send telemetry event ClientStartEvent: capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given
Failed to send telemetry event CollectionQueryEvent: capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given
```

**What it was:** ChromaDB trying to send usage analytics with incompatible method signatures.

**Impact:** None - purely cosmetic, didn't affect functionality.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False` to disable telemetry
- Added warning filters in `config.py`
- Result: Clean output without functional changes

### **LangChain Deprecation Warning (FIXED)**
```
The method `Chain.__call__` was deprecated in langchain 0.1.0 and will be removed in 1.0. Use :meth:`~invoke` instead.
```

**What it was:** Using old LangChain API method.

**Solution Applied:**
- Changed `qa_chain({"question": question})` to `qa_chain.invoke({"question": question})`
- Updated to modern LangChain 0.3 API

### **Import Deprecation Warnings (FIXED)**
```
Importing PyPDFLoader from langchain.document_loaders is deprecated
```

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated imports to use `langchain_community.document_loaders`
- Future-proofed for LangChain 1.0

## üéØ **Result: Clean Output**

After fixes, LUCY runs with minimal warnings and clean output:
```
‚úì LUCY is ready to chat!
üöó LUCY - Ready to Chat!
```

## üö® **Warnings You Can Ignore**

These warnings don't affect functionality and are expected:

### **Chroma Class Deprecation**
```
The class `Chroma` was deprecated in LangChain 0.2.9 and will be removed in 1.0
```
**Why ignore:** The suggested replacement `langchain-chroma` is still in development. Current code works perfectly.

## üîß **Manual Fixes If Needed**

### **If You Still See Telemetry Errors:**
```bash
# Set environment variable before running
export ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False
python chat.py
```

### **If ChromaDB Issues Persist:**
```bash
# Clear vector database and recreate
rm -rf data/vectordb/*
python chat.py
# LUCY will rebuild the database automatically
```

### **If Import Errors Occur:**
```bash
# Reinstall in virtual environment
source lucy-env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## üéâ **System Health Check**

Your LUCY system is healthy if you see:
- ‚úÖ Virtual environment activates: `(lucy-env)` in prompt
- ‚úÖ LUCY starts without errors
- ‚úÖ Responds with British personality
- ‚úÖ Remembers maintenance work
- ‚úÖ Retrieves from documents

## üìä **Performance Notes**

### **Expected Startup Time:**
- First run: 10-15 seconds (building vector database)
- Subsequent runs: 5-8 seconds (loading existing database)

### **Response Time:**
- Simple questions: 2-4 seconds
- Complex queries: 4-8 seconds
- Document ingestion: 1-2 seconds per document

### **Memory Usage:**
- Base system: ~200MB RAM
- With full document collection: ~500MB RAM
- Virtual environment: ~1GB disk space

## üõ†Ô∏è **Advanced Troubleshooting**

### **Slow Responses:**
```python
# Check document count
python -c "from spitfire_rag import TriumphSpitfireRAG; rag = TriumphSpitfireRAG(); print(f'Documents: {len(rag.vectorstore.get()[\"ids\"])}')"
```

### **Memory Issues:**
```bash
# Clear conversation memory (keeps maintenance log)
# In LUCY chat: /clear
```

### **API Key Problems:**
```bash
# Verify .env file
cat .env
# Should show your actual API keys, not "your_key_here"
```
